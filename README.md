# 555 Piezo Trigger

This trigger module helps to sanitize a sensor input to control sound sources (e.g. drum samples) a bit more precisely.

This circuit uses a 555 timer in monostable mode. It reacts to an input event (in this case a tap on a piezoelectric disc, regardless of specific striking force) by outputting a pulse. This single square pulse is variable in duration and amplitude.
